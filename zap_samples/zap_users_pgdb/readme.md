# A CRUD on `/users` sample w/ zap and pg

This is a CRUD example on `/users` API, implemented with:

-   [zap](https://github.com/zigzap/zap) - a Web framework
-   [pg.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/pg.zig) - the native PostgreSQL driver to use it in the persistence layer.

## Start

### Setup

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the PostgreSQL server container in the background.
2. Use Zig version 0.14 (aka the master branch at the time of this writing).

Run `./run_dev.sh` to start the server in "development mode" (restart on code changes). Otherwise, the classic `zig build run` command is enough.
