## A _hello world_ like into `http.zig`

This is a starting point of playing with [http.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig/), an HTTP/1.1 server for zig.

<br/>

### Setup

Note that `build.zig` declares the `"httpz"` module, providing a full path to the location where `http.zig` project exists, aka where its repo has been cloned (`git clone git@github.com:karlseguin/http.zig.git`). This path must point (correctly reflect) your local setup.

<br/>

### Run

Use the classic `zig build run` to run it.
